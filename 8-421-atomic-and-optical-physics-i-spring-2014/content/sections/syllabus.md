Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

[_8.05 Quantum Physics II_](/courses/8-05-quantum-physics-ii-fall-2013/)

Main Topics
-----------

*   The two-state systems: Resonance
*   Atoms—electronic structure
*   Helium atom
*   Fine structure and Lamb shift
*   Hyperfine structure; Magnetic fields
*   Atoms in electric fields
*   Interaction of an Atom with an Electro-Magnetic Field
*   Einstein's A and B coefficient
*   Saturation of transitions
*   Line shapes
*   Two-photon transitions
*   Coherence
*   Dicke superradiance

Requirements
------------

There will be ten problem sets. Assignments will usually be due one week after they have been handed out. There will be no quiz or final exam, but a term paper at the end of the course. This will be a paper in the style of a publication in [Physical Review Letters](http://journals.aps.org/prl/) on a topic of mutual interest. The term paper and the homework have equal weight for the total grade. The term paper will be due on the day of the last class.
